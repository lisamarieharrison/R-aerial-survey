There were \Sexpr{length(unique(dat$Date))} inter-observer surveys between Vic and Lisa. The total number of sightings by each observer are shown in the table below.

<<totalSightings, echo=FALSE>>=
kable(table(dat$Observer, dat$Species), format = "pandoc", caption = "Total sightings by each observer")
@



The sightings were searched for overlaps, where a sighting was seen by each observer and the number of sightings missed by each observer were calculated.

    return(TRUE)

    return(list(overlap = overlap, vic_missed = vic_missed, lisa_missed = lisa_missed))
  } else {
    findOverlap(set1, set2, i = i, j = j + 1, overlap = overlap, lisa_missed = lisa_missed, 
                vic_missed = vic_missed)
  }
    
}

  result <- findOverlap(set1 = vic, set2 = set2, i = i, j = 1, 
                        overlap = overlap, lisa_missed = lisa_missed,

The number of missed sightings of each species is shown in the histogram below. Baitfish were by far the most missed sightings.

<<missedSpecies, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE, width=10>>=
total_missed <- rbind(lisa_missed, vic_missed)
missed_table <- table(total_missed$Observer, total_missed$Species)
x = barplot(missed_table, beside = TRUE, legend = c("Vic", "Lisa"), main = "Number of missed sightings by species", xlab = "Species")
@

The number of missed sightings per survey are shown in the histograms below. The number of missed sightings differed greatly for both observers.

<<missedSurvey, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE, width=10>>=
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(table(total_missed$Observer, total_missed$Date)[1, ], main = "Vic missed", xlab = "", xlim = c(0, 35), col = "lightgrey")
hist(table(total_missed$Observer, total_missed$Date)[2, ], main = "Lisa missed", xlab = "", xlim = c(0, 35), col = "lightgrey")
@

The number of on-effort hours at each sea state were calculated, in order to calculate the number of missed sightings per hour at each sea state. The number of missed sightings gets lower as sea state increases. This is likely because both observers are missing more, rather than a lower percentage of total animals available for sampling are missed at sea states 3 and 4 compared to sea state 1.
